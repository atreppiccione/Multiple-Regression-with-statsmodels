# Multiple-Regression-with-statsmodels

With this repository I will perform a Multiple Regression using Statsmodels.
There are 2 datasets used both of them are in the same excel file:
- "dailyplay" shows daily revenue per player for an online poker game
- "promotions" shows on which date 2 promotions were running 

The aim of the project is to perform a regression using the available data and once the model is built, use it to predict the revenue for "future" days that are in the following table:

Date	      Dayofweek 	Promo 	Players
03/04/2017	Monday 	 	           3,000 
04/04/2017	Tuesday 	   A	     4,000 
05/04/2017	Wednesday	 	         4,000 
06/04/2017	Thursday	   B	     5,000 
07/04/2017	Friday	     A	     6,000 
08/04/2017	Saturday	   B	     6,000 
09/04/2017	Sunday	 	           7,000 

I will also get the 95% confidence intervals for the revenue predictions.
